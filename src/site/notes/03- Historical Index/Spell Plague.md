# Spell Plague

The **Spellplague**, a cataclysmic event in which the Weave collapsed leading to a span of time known as "The Wailing Years".  This period of time was marked by arcane magic not functioning, the unfurled Weave causing places on Toril to transform, and the emergence of wild magic.  People who came in contact with the spellplague were transformed, outright obliterated or bestowed terrible powers.

### Weave
The **Weave**, controlled by Mystra is the manner through which raw magic is accessed.  The Weave is the way in which magic presented itself to beings for their use, and it flowed throughout the world touching almost every corner of existence, with the exception of certain places on Toril.

### Wild Magic
**Wild magic** zones were areas where the Weave was damaged or distorted. In such areas, a spell could backfire upon its caster, target the wrong location, be dramatically increased in power, or indeed, anything could occur.
