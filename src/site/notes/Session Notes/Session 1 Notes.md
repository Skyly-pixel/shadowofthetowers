# Session 1 Notes

- Turmish, locale with crumbling battlements that the town used as structures to build off of.  The town is not particularly nice, but it's a humble home.
- Post Spell-plague.
- Sad drinker in the bar, Guinevere, monk gets her some shots
- Human bartender with big bushy mustache, co-owner named Guinevere.
- Four-ish days ago a party came through, stand-offish, looking to explore mage tower.  There was a flash recently, Guinevere's husband went to check and hasn't returned.
- Flash caused some strange body replacements, like people who's arms were replaced with chicken "arms".  Happened deep in the night, may be a recurring event?
- Teran - One victim of the chicken arm-ening.
- May be cursed by a flash of wild magic, a stroke of bad luck it seems, there's no other signs pointing to why Teran was specifically affected.  This curse can be reversed though.
- We head to the tower at midday, traveling immediately.
- Peter flies in an open hole and monk friend squeezes through a hole in the construction of the tower.
- Entryway clearly has been trekked through recently.
- We fight some strange melting zombie acid creatures that are disgusting and dangerous.
- Second floor is a large room, more decorative and lavish than the previous floor.  Music, classical in nature, emanating from a room upstairs.  A person in the room calls out and lets us know the Mage Tower hasn't had a proper master for a very long period of time.  Fairy sized conductor, guardian, familiar.  Warblidrak has the opportunity to name the fairy.
- Jameira whom we don't know was slated to be the new master of the tower.
- Mentions magical experiments that are still active within the tower.
- Some creature laid out on a table, with various tinctures nearby.
