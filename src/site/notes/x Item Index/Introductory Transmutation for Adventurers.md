# Introductory Transmutation for Adventurers

The spellbook entitled **Introductory Transmutation for Adventurers** is written in such a way that the runes are intended to be deciphered by novice wizards, with little of the flourish associated with a typical Wizard's spellbook and runes. Because of this, the reader needn't spend as much time copying the spells within (the time is reduced by half).

Level 1 Spells: *Feather Fall, Longstrider, Catapult* 

Level 2 Spells: *Alter Self, Darkvision, Dragon's Breath, Heat Metal*

*The tome is well-worn and thoroughly studied. It is patched along the bindings, indicating that whoever owned this book, it was thoroughly cared for.

On the front cover, a name is written in scratchy, blocky letters that look as if they were written by a young child. The ink has faded and worn with time, but the letters 'Tau' are visible as the first three.*
